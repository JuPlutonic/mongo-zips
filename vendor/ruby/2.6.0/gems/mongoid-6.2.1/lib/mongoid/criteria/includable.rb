      # Eager loads all the provided relations. Will load all the documents
      # into the identity map whose ids match based on the extra query for the
      # ids.
      #
      # @note This will work for embedded relations that reference another
      #   collection via belongs_to as well.
      #
      # @note Eager loading brings all the documents into memory, so there is a
      #   sweet spot on the performance gains. Internal benchmarks show that
      #   eager loading becomes slower around 100k documents, but this will
      #   naturally depend on the specific application.
      #
      # @example Eager load the provided relations.
      #   Person.includes(:posts, :game)
      #
      # @param [ Array<Symbol>, Array<Hash> ] relations The names of the relations to eager
      #   load.

      # @return [ Criteria ] The cloned criteria.
